# Personal_Bank_loan_prediction
The dataset contains information of 5000 costumers of a bank. It contains personal information of the user like age, income, years of job experience, education and number of family numbers. It also contains information about costumer's association with the bank: value of house mortgage, average credit card spending, Securities Account:Does the customer have a securities account with the bank? ,CD Account:Does the customer have a certificate of deposit (CD) account with the bank?, Online:Does the customer use internet banking facilities?, Credit Card:Does the customer use a credit card issued by UniversalBank? Based on the information, we predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loan from the bank using K nearest neighbours algorithm, logistic regression, SVM using Gaussian kernel and compare the result obtained from the three algorithms.
